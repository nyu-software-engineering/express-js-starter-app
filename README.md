# Express.js Starter App

## Concept

This project shows some basic usage of Express.js features, including:

- handling incoming HTTP requests using express routes
- exploring the purpose of middleware and how it works
- debugging express apps using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- handling data included in HTTP POST requests
- handling file uploads using [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
- making requests from express to external APIs with [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and serving the data to the client
- setting environmental variables using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- use of a `.gitignore` file to exclude 3rd-party code and autogenerated files from version control tracking
- use of a `package.json` with npm to track dependencies and streamline installation.

Many of the features of Express exhibited in this project are explained at a high level in this [prepared lecture presentation](https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/software-engineering/express/).

## Intentional exclusions

There are some common practices that we have not included here, since we believe they are distraction's from a beginner's ability to master React's code patterns.

- inclusion of any front-end code
- inclusion of user account registration or log in functionality
- inclusion of unit testing modules, like mocha and chaai
- use of express-router

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` - install dependencies

Installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` configuration file.
This is necessary before running the app, since the 3rd-party dependency code is excluded from version control by the `.gitignore` git settings file.

### `nodemon server` - start the server locally

Start up the web server application using `nodemon`, which will stop and restart the app anytime there is a code change. The server will be available on port `3000` of the local computer at the URL, `http://localhost:3000`.

## Server API End-Points

This server code sets up routes for several API end-points - URLs to which a client can make requests. Except where indicated, the server accepts `GET` requests to these routes.

The example routes include:

- `/` - a route for the "root" document - usually the home page, but in this case a simple text response.
- `/html-example` - a route that shows how to return a simple HTML document.
- `/static/css/main.css` - a route that servers as an example of servnig a static file that does not need dynamic server logic.
- `/json-example` - a route that shows how the server can respond with a JSON document.
- `/middleware-example` - a route that exhibits the concept of middleware.
- `/post-example` - a route that accepts `POST` requests with some content the server expects the client to send in the body of the request.
- `/upload-example` - a route that accepts a `POST` request with one or more files in the request that the client uploads to the server.
- `/proxy-example` - a route that causes the server to make a request to a different API and then respond to the client with the data received from that API.
- `/dotenv-example` - a route that shows how a server can use the `dotenv` module to load environmental variables from a file named `.env` into Javascript code.
- `/parameter-example/22` - a route that shows an example of how parts of the route URL - in this case the number `22` - can be parameterized and accessed in code.

### Running the server

### Testing the routes

It is possible to try out the routes directly in a web browser. However, it is often more convenient to use an API-testing tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test out the server API end-points.

- Import the test file named `express-js-starter-app.postman_collection.json` into Postman to test out the API end-points.
